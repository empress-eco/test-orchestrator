## About The Project

### ðŸ“– Overview
Test Orchestrator is a versatile tool that simplifies and accelerates your unit testing process by enabling parallel execution of tests. It is the perfect solution for developers aiming to increase their productivity and optimize their testing procedures.

### ðŸŒŸ Key Features
- Parallel execution of unit tests
- Ability to register a test instance
- Fetching the next available test to run

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
To utilize Test Orchestrator effectively, you need to have unique IDs for both the build in CI and the instance running parallel tests. 

### Installation
Clone the repository and follow these steps to get Test Orchestrator up and running:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/empress-eco/test-orchestrator.git
cd test-orchestrator

```

## Usage
After registering a test instance with the list of all tests to execute, the test instance can request the next available test to run. Test Orchestrator will then assign you a test from the registered test list.
